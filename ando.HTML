            <img src="first.jpg" class="pics">
<p>Cordova became a municipality in 1864, and from 1913 up to the present, a total of 15 mayors governed the district.

    The Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway, which was completed in 2022, connects the town to Cebu City in mainland Cebu. This is the third bridge connecting mainland Cebu to Mactan Island, after the Mactan–Mandaue Bridge and the Marcelo Fernan Bridge, both of which connect the cities of Mandaue in the mainland and Lapu-Lapu City in Mactan.</p>

<p>With local tourism in place, Cordovanhons hold a good grip at their chance at regaining their economy and livelihood again.

    Local boatmen, trisikad drivers, local tour guides, women association, persons with disabilities and local sectors were tapped to create a holistic and all-inclusive tourism experience. The tour package includes transportation, food, souvenir and local guide. This way, direct benefits are poured into the local community thus creating sustainable tourism for all.
    
    One of our local partners, Cordova Island Hopping, was also present at this event. They operate island hopping activities around Mactan Islands. They specialize in providing authentic island experience and in serving Filipino lunch buffet that is freshly grilled by the friendly boat crew. They too were hardly hit by travel restrictions. Today, they are hopeful that things will get better and that local tourism can recover.</p>
